# K-Way Merge

## Overview
The **K-Way Merge** technique is used to merge multiple sorted arrays, linked lists, or other sorted data structures into a single sorted output. This technique is frequently employed in problems that require merging multiple datasets efficiently, often utilizing a **min-heap** (priority queue) to manage and retrieve the smallest elements across different data sources.

## When to Use:
- **Merging multiple sorted arrays**: When given K sorted arrays or lists, and you need to produce a single merged sorted output.
- **Finding smallest ranges**: When working with multiple sorted lists and tasked with finding the smallest range covering one element from each list.
- **Finding Kth smallest elements**: Commonly used in problems involving matrices or large datasets where you need to find the Kth smallest element across sorted structures.

## Effective Scenarios:
- **Arrays and Linked Lists**: Especially effective when the input data is provided in the form of sorted arrays or lists.
- **Dynamic datasets**: Where you need to maintain the smallest or largest element in dynamic data streams or during repeated queries.

## How to Recognize Problems that Use K-Way Merge:
- **Merge sorted lists/arrays**: If the problem asks to merge K sorted lists/arrays into one sorted output.
- **Finding Kth smallest/largest elements**: If the task is to find a specific Kth element in a sorted matrix or dataset.
- **Smallest range problems**: If the problem involves finding ranges that cover elements from multiple lists.

## Example Problem Types:
- **Merge K Sorted Lists**: Merging K linked lists into one sorted linked list.
- **Smallest Range Covering K Lists**: Finding the smallest range that includes at least one number from each list.
- **Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix**: Finding the Kth smallest element in a row-wise and column-wise sorted matrix.

## Smart Hacks to Recognize K-Way Merge Problems:
- **Multiple Sorted Inputs**: If the problem has multiple sorted lists or arrays to combine.
- **Finding Minimum/Maximum Elements**: If the goal is to find the minimum/maximum element across datasets.
- **Dynamic Data Queries**: When working with data that is frequently updated or queried for specific elements like the smallest or Kth smallest.

## Key Code Components:
- **Min-Heap (Priority Queue)**: Frequently used to extract the smallest element across different data structures efficiently.
- **Node Class**: A helper class to store the value, index, and sometimes row/column information to manage elements in the heap.
